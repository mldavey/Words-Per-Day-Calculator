Words Per Day Calculator Script

---------------------------------------------------------------
This is a basic Python script meant to calculate how many words you have left to meet your word count goal in a specified amount of time.

Input your start date, end date, total words required, and any words you've done so far.  If you're already past your start date or your start date is today, the script will also ask if you want to include today in your calculations.  It will calculate your remaining words per day and tell you how many days you have left until your deadline.

Please re-use/modify this script to meet your needs.  I hope someone finds it helpful, and keep on writing!
